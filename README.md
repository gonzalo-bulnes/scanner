Contributing
------------

Writing this package was mostly for me an opportunity to practice with some [concurrency primitives in Go][book] and I don't expect this code to be imported or used as package. There is very little to it and you could probably re-write or copy it just as quick? That is to say that I don't expect many contributions either.

However, contributions are welcome. Code reviews in particular would be greatly appreciated. Please feel welcome to open an issue and share your thoughts! : )
